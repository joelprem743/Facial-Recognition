# Machine Learning Face Age Classifier

This project implements a machine learning classifier to distinguish between young adult and older adult faces using computer vision techniques.

## Features
- Uses LAB color space for image processing
- Implements Gaussian probability model for classification
- Includes visualization of mean faces and pixel deviations
- Provides accuracy metrics for both age groups

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
